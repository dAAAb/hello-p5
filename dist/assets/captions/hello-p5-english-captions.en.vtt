00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.750
I made this with p5js 

2
00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:05.750
I made this with p5 dot js 

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.750
I made this with p5js 

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
P5js is a javascript library for making web-based 

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
interactive experiences and having fun with code. 


6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
With p5js you can quickly create animations,

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
games, data visualizations, generative art, and more


8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
P5js is an amazing program for making any animation or 

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
javascript project that you are wanting to do 

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Programming with p5 is just like using javascript, 

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.500
but it includes built in tools for coding cool stuff.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.500
It’s designed to be easy for beginners, 
 
13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
but robust enough for experienced artists, 

14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
developers, dreamers, and inventors. 

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.500
And since browsers speak in javascript, 

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
you can share your work with others online. 

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
It’s mobile friendly too!

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Your imagination is the limit!

19
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
With just a few lines of code you can make shapes, like this circle, on your screen 

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:61.500
With just a few lines of code you can make shapes, like this circle, on your screen 


12
00:00:61.500 --> 00:00:63.500
Without p5, writing this out would take a lot more code. 

13  
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
The fun can multiply from there 

14
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Bring them to life with movement 

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
or make them interactive. Try clicking or tapping the screen


16 
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.500
P5js helps you get your ideas on screen quickly. And since you can see the results of your code visually, it’s a great for learning programming concepts.

16 
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Your imagination is the limit. 

17
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.500
P5js is free and easy to set up. You can either code right in your browser using the p5 web editor, 

18
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
or download the javascript libraries to your computer . No special software required. 

19
