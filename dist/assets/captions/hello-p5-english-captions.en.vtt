00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
I made this in p5js 

2
00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:04.260
I made this with p5 dot js 

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.230
I made this with p5js 

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.250
P5js is a javascript library 

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.000
for making web-based 

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.200
interactive experiences 

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.500
and having fun with code. 

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
With p5js you can quickly create 

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.250
animations, games, data visualizations,

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.000
generative art, and more


8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.000
P5js is an amazing program to get you started 

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.500
on any animation or cool javascript project

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
that you are trying to do 

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Programming with p5 is just like using javascript, 

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.500
but with built in tools for coding cool stuff.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It’s designed to be easy for beginners, 

 
13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.250
but robust enough for experienced developers 

14
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.000
designers, dreamers, and inventors. 

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
And since browsers speak in javascript, 

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
you can share your work with others online. 

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It’s mobile friendly too!

18
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.000
Your imagination is the limit!

19
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.000
With just a few lines of code you can make shapes,

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:60.000
like this circle, on your screen 

12
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750
Without p5, writing this out would take a lot more code. 

13  
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.000 
The fun can multiply from there 

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Bring them to life with movement 

15
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.260
or make them interactive. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.260 
Try clicking or tapping the screen


16 
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
P5js helps you to get your ideas on screen quickly. 

16 
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.270
And since you can see the results of your code 

16 
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.070
it’s a great for learning programming concepts.

16 
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.500
Its the best!

16 
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.000
you can do anything with p5js

16 
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000
p5js gets also used by graphic designers who are not used to code.

16 
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.000
p5js gets me excited

16 
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000
*children's laughter*

17
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
P5js is free and easy to set up. 

17
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.100
You can either code right in your browser using the p5 web editor, 

18
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:30.500
or download the javascript libraries to your computer.

18
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
No special software required. 

19
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.000
There are lots of great tutorials to help you get started. 

19
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.070
But if you get stuck - don’t worry, 


19
00:01:49.070--> 00:01:51.500
you can always ask for help in our community forums 
21
00:01:52.500--> 00:01:53.250
